 proposes an encryption-and-compression-based technique for medical images. First, chaos-based encryption is used
 to encrypt the image, then the encrypted image is downsampled using lossy compression. Meanwhile, a customised deep learning
 model is adopted to reconstruct the image, thereby reducing the memory and bandwidth cost and improving the security of the
 medical images. The assessment of the proposed algorithm was conducted in terms of perceptual quality analysis, key space analysis,
 differential and statistical analysis, execution time and resistance to noise attack. The experimental results showed that the proposed
 algorithm was able to achieve superior performance compared with existing methods. In future, we will further explore the proposed
 method for other media applications. The 3D models security can be explore in addition to the 2D media security needs to be
 addressed in further study
